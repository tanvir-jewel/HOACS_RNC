# HOACS: Homomorphic Obfuscation Assisted Concealing of Secrets

This repository contains the C code implementations used in the research paper "HOACS: Homomorphic Obfuscation Assisted Concealing of Secrets to Thwart Trojan Attacks in COTS Processor" by T Hossain, M Showers, M Hasan, T Hoque, published as an arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.09701 in 2024.

## Overview

The HOACS (Homomorphic Obfuscation Assisted Concealing of Secrets) project aims to enhance the security of COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) processors against Trojan attacks through the application of homomorphic obfuscation techniques. This repository includes the C implementations of various algorithms that support the theoretical concepts presented in our paper, focusing on operations within the Residue Number System (RNS) to achieve secure computation.

## Content

The repository contains implementations of the following RNS operations:

- Addition in RNC
- Subtraction in RNC
- Shifting in RNC
- Multiplication in RNC
- Division in RNC
- Exponential Operation in RNC
- Modulus Operation in RNC
- Equality Operation in RNC

Each of these operations is crucial for the homomorphic obfuscation techniques discussed in our paper, providing a foundational layer for building secure computation protocols on COTS processors.

## Usage

To use the code in your projects, clone this repository and include the desired C files in your project. Each file is a standalone implementation of the corresponding RNS operation.
